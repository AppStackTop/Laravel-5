# What is Laravel and what does it do

Laravel is a MVC php framework that helps with rapid application development. It was created and maintained by Taylor Otwell.

It has become very popular and is holding a strong community around it.

Some of the tools that it gives you out of the box are User authentication which that outline saves hours of time. Imagine creating a login form, creating a database for your user, hashing the password and creating the session state so you can have a logged in user. With Laravel you get that out of the box.
